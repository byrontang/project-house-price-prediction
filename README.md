# project-house-price-prediction
This project uses [Kaggle's House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) to discuss the application of various regression models, including sigle models and ensemble models, for predicting continuous target, with algorithms and objective functions listed where applicable. The goals of this project are:
- perform data exploration and build standard sklearn estimator for data transform
- connect the mathmetical formulas with model building through scikit-learn and XGBoost
- gain experiences on modeling optimization techniques.

Eventually, this project could be the fundation of machine learning projects for future regression problems.

There are three main workbooks in this project for different topics as below. 

- **Data Exploration & Preparation:** Current workbook
- **Modeling with Scikit Learn:** Please refer to notebook modeling
- **Modeling with Scikit Learn:** Please refer to notebook gradient-boosting
